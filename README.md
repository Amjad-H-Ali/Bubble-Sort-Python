# Bubble-Sort-Python

##### Description
###### Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.  
##### Complexity
###### Time: worst _O_(_n_<sup>2</sup>), best _O_(_n_), average _O_(_n_<sup>2</sup>)
###### Space: worst _O_(1) auxiliary
